## Graph Convolutional Networks in Apache Spark

Implementation of the GCN(https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907) on top of Spark using Analytics Zoo. It is based on the Keras repo https://github.com/tkipf/keras-gcn.

It is implemented for the moment only the Cora example. The main program included in the CoraExample module start a training process using only 140 input samples from the Cora dataset.
